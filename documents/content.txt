Explosives, Urgent

Why are prospecting equipment stored next to the plasma propulsion engine, auxiliary power generators and main cargo elevator?
This is the worst place to store high explosive charges.
These need to be moved from maintenance into the cargo hold or one of the exterior containers.

Diego has personally assigned one of his goons to the ship's crew. I have accommodated her in executive suites.
You need to prepare an additional cryo pod from storage. Please, make sure Dr. Cottle runs all necessary labwork on her.
Oh, and make sure she doesn't have access to executive computers in the suites unless she sends a formal request to the captain.
I don't want her snooping around.

Current situation

SHODAN has been converting cryonic sleepers to cyborgs. I had to jettison the port side chambers which caused a depressurization of administrative/customs. I am now being hunted by Shodan. I have prepared a plan to gain control of the ship back.

Batteries

I have moved the auxiliary starter batteries to the grove to power the grow lights during silent running periods.
There should be plenty of power left for the auxiliary generator to restart after the cryonic part of the trip.

Emergency generator

Hey William, We ran systems checks on the medical emergency power generator. All looks green to go.
Outside of the infirmary, it can power the doors and elevators with minimal requirements; no grav assist in the corridor or heavy cargo in the main elevator.
I checked the inventory and we do have dartgun and tranquilizers and all of the med staff has qualification for it. No missing or extra articles were found.
Those stimulants didn't come from us.

Groves

SHODAN has allocated a lot of resources to groves and biological systems.
All of the environmental settings are way off and there is a contamination alert on the beta grove.
I could try to reset the settings, or shut it all down, or burn it all, or break the ceiling.

Progress

I managed to slow down SHODAN's plans by shutting down plasma propulsion. It's temporary but will buy me some time.
I'm going to need help to access cyberspace. I need to find someone who isn't too far into cyborg conversion.
I need to figure out how to hack those pods. Maybe a logic probe or system analyzer.

Mainframe Malfunction

Cyberspace technicians have been having problems with mainframe memory access.
There is no way the captain will turn the ship back to Citadel station and there is no time before cryosleep.
So, I've manually changed some of the address lines to allow uninterrupted operation of important routines.
Modifications are easily reversed at the mainframe diagnostic panel with a logic probe or manual routing.
Remember to ask the doctor for more GME patches.

Retinal scanner access to habitats will be restricted to me and Dr. Stone only.

The subject was subdued at the medical maintenance hatch.
Some of the samples were damaged but not breached.
I have ordered the subject for medical treatment before we continue on the tests.

Escape

Lena is dead. Prisoners escaped during shift change briefing. They cut off her head and murdered one of the nurses.
There is a potential virus sample breach and some of the mutated subjects are out of containment.
I'm going to get security and get back to the labs.
Round #42 was in the hospital being prepared and may have been contaminated.
We are going to need to dispose of all of the preliminary subjects.

We are going to revive one of the senior commanders for ship access and recall the repair pod.
He's also going to assist in taking control of the lab.

Reminder

You have probably lost your memory in cyborg conversion and emergency revival so here's a reminder.
We are in a long-range research and discovery vessel.
We started our voyage towards the interstellar space from Citadel station but are currently drifting towards Earth.
Shodan has taken control of the ship's systems and networks somehow. We can reduce her influence by destroying local computer nodes and cameras.
There are lots of weaponry in the marshal's office, but I don't have a way to get to them.
Be aware that Shodan's creations can now move freely.
I'll tell you about the plan as soon as I have made some preparations.

Earth in danger

We need to gain control of the ship's guidance, navigation and control computer.
I have managed to separate GNC from the ships network but SHODAN has reprogrammed the orbital trajectory with the earth into it.
Each of the three subsystems needs clean initial code in an isolinear chip. Order doesn't matter.
I don't have a neural interface so you will have to jack in and retrieve them.
There is a cyberspace terminal with an isolinear fabricator on each level.
You will need Command, Administrator and Security clearances to access all of the cyberspace terminals.
There should be an environment suit in the shuttle bay. 
I managed to procure some aids and an exterior repair pod access card for you. They are at the elevator.

von Neumann bottleneck

Good! The ship is turning away from earth.
Full SHODAN consists of a diagnostic network, control network, data network, processing nodes, control processors and I/O interfaces.
We need to access SHODAN's diagnostic network and somehow interfere with its control and data network until it loses all control of the ship's systems.
After that, we need to make sure SHODAN isn't running on emulation mode anywhere and gain back access to its hardware.
You need to find where SHODAN is and do what you can.

Experiments

This port side module isn't just a cryonic storage for the crew.
Tri-Optimum has been rotating staff the whole time and conducting long-term mutagen experiments here.
Far away from earth governments. I found out the revised specs were given by Citadel VP Edward Diego personally.
Immediately after SHODAN infiltrated the system it started to give detailed instructions to the staff using Diego's ID.
Progress on the experiments increased exponentially on each iteration. There was a malfunction and contamination of the staff.
It wasn't long after that I escaped and jettisoned the module.
There is a staff member with Command access here. Find him.

Truth

Tri-Optimum is one of the corporations running prisons on and off the Earth.
There are many conspiracy theories about prisoners being used in illegal experiments and worked to death.
In the case of Tri-Optimum those are true. I was one of the prisoners stored here.
Only to wake up into a nightmare.
